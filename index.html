    <div class="poem">
        <div class="poem-line">They that have power to hurt and will do none,</div>
        <div class="poem-line indent">That do not do the thing they most do show,</div>
        <div class="poem-line">Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,</div>
        <div class="poem-line indent">Unmoved, cold and to temptation slow:</div>
        <div class="poem-line">They rightly do inherit heaven's graces</div>
        <div class="poem-line indent">And husband nature's riches from expense;</div>
        <div class="poem-line">They are the lords and owners of their faces,</div>
        <div class="poem-line indent">Others but stewards of their excellence.</div>
        <div class="poem-line">The summer's flower is to the summer sweet</div>
        <div class="poem-line indent">Though to itself it only live and die,</div>
        <div class="poem-line">But if that flower with base infection meet,</div>
        <div class="poem-line indent">The basest weed outbraves its dignity:</div>
        <div class="poem-line indent2">For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;</div>
        <div class="poem-line indent2">Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.</div>
