    <p>They who have power to hurt and will do none<br>
        Who do not do the thing they most do show<br>
        Who, moving others, are themselves as stone<br>
        Unmoving, cold and to temptation slow,<br>
        They rightly do inherit heaven's graces<br>
        And husband nature's riches from expense<br>
        They are the lords and owners of their faces,<br>
        Others but stewards of their excellence.<br>
        The summer's flower is to the summer sweet<br>
        Though to itself it only live and die<br>
        But if that flower with base infection meet<br>
        The basest weed outbraves its dignity.<br>
        So sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;<br>
        Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds. <br>
    </p>
